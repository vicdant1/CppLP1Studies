learning cmake (for absolute no reason)

cmake comes from Makefile

make file -> make command

make basically runs pretty much everything that is setted up on makefile

cmake runs on top of a CMakeLists.txt file instead of a makefile

create a build directory and inside this directory create build stuff


mkdir build

cd build

cmake -S ../ -B .

what this command line says is basically "CMakeLists.txt is over a directory above and build path is going to be the present directory"

then cmake generate a bunch of files we never touch.


CMakeLists.txt have a bunch of different commands and the most part of them will come when we need it, but til now (the really basics) what we had was:


cmake_minimum_required(VERSION xx.xx.xx)

project(ProjectName)

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} main.cpp)
