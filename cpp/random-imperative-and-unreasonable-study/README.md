Welcome to this repository, specially this folder.

I have no idea why you lost you time opening this, but if telling you why I started it makes you happier, so fine.

I must to say that some stranger things from computering makes me really excited, and learning how to code better in C++ (for absolute no reason since I don't even will need it at work or college) looked me a good idea.

So, lets go ahead with me on this insane journey, hope you get as excited as me.


PS: for your information, all the source code provided on this repository was originally written on VIM (like ancient Greek people used to do).
