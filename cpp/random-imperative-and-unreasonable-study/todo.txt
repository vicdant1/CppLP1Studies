TODO List:

- Install WSL/Linux environment (since windows libs are really diffent because of system's kernel)
- Improve my VIM knownledge
- Learn about cmake
- Learn about compilers
- Learn about debbugers
- Learn about C++
	- Learn about SSH keys on git repositories (ICam project)
	- Remember main concepts
	- Think about projects organization with C++
	- How to integrate libraries with C++
	- Graphic interface on C++
	- Threads, Processes, Kernels, etc.

Of course it will be something I'll do on my free time and since I'm a software engineer, I have no free time. Maybe when I get bored about do something so stranger that I can't even register on this repository, I'll touch it again.
